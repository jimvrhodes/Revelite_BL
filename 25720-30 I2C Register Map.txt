9.6.2 ChargeCurrent Register (SMBus address = 14h) [reset = 0000h]
To set the charge current, write a 16-bit ChargeCurrent() command (REG0x14h()) using the data format listed in
Figure 9-7, Table 9-12, and Table 9-13.
With 10-mΩ sense resistor, the charger provides charge current range of 0 A to 8.128 A, with a 64-mA step
resolution.
Upon POR, ChargeCurrent() is 0 A. Below scenarios will also reset Charge current to zero:
• CELL_BATPRESZ going LOW (battery removal).
• STAT_AC is not valid (adapter removal).
• RESET_REG is asserted and reset all registers.
• Charge voltage is written to be 0 V.
• Watch dog event is triggered.
Charge current is not reset in force converter latch off fault (REG0x20[2]), and ACOC/TSHUT/SYSOVP/ACOV/
VSYS_UVP/BATOVP/BATOC faults.
The SRP and SRN pins are used to sense voltage drop across RSR with default value of 10 mΩ. However, the
host can always set current sensing to 5 mΩ referring to Section 9.3.6. For a smaller sense resistor, a smaller
sense voltage is given, and a lower regulation accuracy; but at the benefit of lower conduction loss.

9.6.2.1 Battery Pre-Charge Current Clamp
During pre-charge, BATFET works in linear mode (LDO mode) (default EN_LDO= 1b). For 2-4 cell battery, the
system is regulated at VSYS_MIN register and the pre-charge current is clamped at 384 mA. For 1 cell battery,
the pre-charge to fast charge threshold is 3 V, and the pre-charge current is clamped at 384 mA. However, the
BATFET stays in LDO mode operation untill battery voltage is above minimum system voltage (~3.6 V). During
battery voltage from 3 V to 3.6 V, the fast charge current is clamped at 2 A.

9.6.3 ChargeVoltage Register (SMBus address = 15h) [reset value based on CELL_BATPRESZ pin
setting]
To set the output charge voltage, write a 16-bit ChargeVoltage register command (REG0x15()) using the data
format listed in Figure 9-8, Table 9-14, and Table 9-15. The charger provides charge voltage range from 1.024 V
to 19.200 V, with 8-mV step resolution. Any write below 1.024 V or above19.200 V is ignored
Upon POR, REG0x15() is by default set as 4200 mV for 1 s, 8400 mV for 2 s, 12600 mV for 3 s or 16800 mV
for 4 s. After CHRG_OK goes high, the charge will start when the host writes the charging current to REG0x14(),
the default charging voltage is used if REG0x15() is not programmed. If the battery is different from 4.2 V/cell,
the host has to write to REG0x15() before REG0x14() for correct battery voltage setting. Writing REG0x15() to 0
should keep REG0x15() value unchanged, and force REG0x14() to zero to disable charge.
The SRN pin senses the battery voltage for voltage regulation and should be connected as close to the battery
as possible.

blocked by any status of /PROCHOT. The exit of VAP mode also
follows the host command, except that any faults will exit VAP mode
automatically. STAT_EXIT_VAP (REG0x21[8]) becomes 1 which will
pull low /PROCHOT until host clear.
The host can enable VAP by setting OTG/VAP/FRS pin high and
0x32[5]=0, disable VAP by setting either OTG/VAP/FRS pin low
or 0x32[5]=1. Any faults in VAP When IN_VAP bit goes 0->1,
charger should disable VINDPM, IIN_DPM, ICRIT, ILIM pin, disable
PP_ACOK if it is enabled, enable PP_VSYS if it is disabled. When
IN_VAP bit goes 1->0, charger should enable VINDPM, IIN_DPM,

9.6.6 IIN_DPM Register With 10-mΩ Sense Resistor (SMBus address = 22h) [reset = 4100h]
IIN_DPM register reflects the actual input current limit programmed in the register, either from IIN_HOST register
or from ICO.
After ICO, the current limit used by DPM regulation may differ from the IIN_HOST register settings. The actual
DPM limit is reported in IIN_DPM register.
To read the nominal or typical input current limit:
• When using a 10-mΩ sense resistor(RSNS_RAC=0b). There is 50mA offset at code 0. Note this offset is only
applied to code 0, not applied to other codes.
• When using a 5-mΩ sense resistor(RSNS_RAC=1b). There is 100mA offset at code 0. Note this offset is only
applied to code 0, not applied to other codes.
To read the maximum input current limit, need to add 100mA/200mA offset based on above nominal input
current limit reading approach:
• When using a 10-mΩ sense resistor(RSNS_RAC=0b). There is 150mA offset at code 0 and this 150mA offset
is only applied to code 0, 100mA offset should be added for all other non-zero codes.
• When using a 5-mΩ sense resistor(RSNS_RAC=1b). There is 300mA offset at code 0 and this 300mA offset
is only applied to code 0, 200mA offset should be added for all other non-zero codes

1 EN_SHIP_DCHG R/W 0b Discharge SRN for Shipping Mode. Used to discharge VBAT pin capacitor
voltage which is necessary for battery gauge device shipping mode.
When this bit is 1, discharge SRN pin down in 140 ms with around 10mA current
flowing through both SRN and SRP pin, totally 20mA. When 140 ms is over, this
bit is reset to 0 automatically. If this bit is written to 0b by host before 140ms
expires, VSYS should stop discharging immediately. After SRN is discharged
to 0V the discharge current will shut off automatically in order to get rid of any
negative voltage on SRN pin. Note if after 140ms SRN voltage is still not low
enough for battery gauge device entering ship mode, the host may need to write
this bit to 1b again to start a new 140ms discharge cycle.

the thresholds. The threshold range from 3.2V(000000b) to 9.5V(111111b) for 2s~ and 3.2V(000000b) to
3.9V(000111b)for 1S, with 100-mV step resolution. There is a fixed DC offset which is 3.2V. Under 1S application
writing beyond 3.9V will be ignored. For example 000111b and xxx111b result in same VSYS_TH1 setting 3.9V.

If the input voltage drops more than the InputVoltage register allows, the device enters VINDPM and reduces the
charge current. The default setting is 1.28 V below the no-load VBUS voltage. There is fixed offset voltage 3.2V
for all codes.

9.6.22 VSYS_MIN Register (SMBus address = 3Eh) [reset value based on CELL_BATPRESZ pin setting]
To set the minimum system voltage, write a 16-bit VSYS_MIN register command (REG0x3E()) using the data
format listed in Figure 9-27, Table 9-48, and Table 9-49. The charger provides minimum system voltage range
from 1.0V to 19.2 V, with 100-mV step resolution. Any write below 1.0V or above 19.2 V is ignored. Upon POR,
the VSYS_MIN register is 3.6 V for 1 S, 6.6V for 2 S and 9.2 V for 3 S, and 12.3 V for 4 S. Writing VSYS_MIN to
0 will set it to the default value based on CELL_BATPRESZ pin.

9.6.23 IIN_HOST Register (SMBus address = 3Fh) [reset = 4100h]
To set the nominal input current limit based on the adapter rated current. Write a 7-bit IIN_HOST register
command using the data format listed in Figure 9-28, and Table 9-50.
When using a 10-mΩ sense resistor (RSNS_RAC=0b), the charger provides a nominal input-current limit range
of 50 mA to 6350 mA, with 50-mA resolution. The upper boundary is implemented through DAC clamp, writing
value higher than limitation will be neglected. The lower boundary is implemented through 50mA offset at code
0. Note this offset is only applied to code 0, not applied to other codes. The default nominal input current limit is
3.25 A. Upon adapter removal, the input current limit is reset to the default value of 3.25 A.
When using a 5-mΩ sense resistor (RSNS_RAC=1b) referring to Section 9.3.6, the input-current limit range can
be found under certain IADPT pin, EN_FAST_5MOHM bit status. The lower boundary is implemented through
100-mA offset at code 0. Note this offset is only applied to code 0, not applied to other codes. The default current
limit is 3.2 A. Due to the USB current setting requirement, the register setting specifies the maximum current
instead of the typical current. Upon adapter removal, the nominal input current limit is reset to the default value
of 3.2 A.
To set the maximum input current limit based on adapter rated current. Additional 100mA(10-mΩ sense resistor)/
200mA(5-mΩ sense resistor) offset should be added based on above nominal input current limit to obtain the
maximum input current limit.
The ACP and ACN pins are used to sense RAC with the default value of 10 mΩ.
Instead of using the internal IIN_DPM loop, the user can build up an external input current regulation loop and
have the control signal on the ILIM_HIZ pin.
In order to disable ILIM_HIZ pin, the host can write to 0x31[7] to disable ILIM_HIZ pin, or pull ILIM_HIZ pin
above 4.0 V.
