This is a battery powered LED light with two channels.
The schematic blocks are: 
 - USBCPD input to a 
- Texas Instruments BQ25730 battery charger via I2C
- through a LTC2944 fuel gauge management IC via I2C
- through a boost
- to two Infineon ILD8150 LED drivers

Right now the basics are working on the hardware, looks good.  I have LEDs on and generating light.

I need help getting the battery charger working.
Then we need to be able to monitor the battery charger
Then we need to engage the LT2944 fuel gauge management chip

I have a PSoC Creator project in C:\Users\jimvr\WarpWorking\Revelite_Batt
battery.c and .h are where I want the charger code to go
LT2944.c and .h for the fuel gauge

I have a 14.4V LiPo battery pack connected to the battery input
USBV is connected to the board
LEDs are on at a very low output

Can you help me to get the charger and the fuel gauge going?
What do I need to get for you?


Battery config is 4S - 4 cells in series
Let's start with 1A of charge current
there is main.c and subs.c for all code, isr.c is there too for timers, LED output filter and analog measurements
I2CM is the master I2C devlce
LT2944 7-bit device address is 1100100 or 0x64
Battery is 50.4WHours, that is 50 watt hours

NOte that I also have a serial debug terminal, there is code in main.c for an example, perhaps we need a CLI.c layer as well (command line interface) so that we can use that.  This is a CY8C4245PVI so we have some room, but not a lot of FLASH to implement complicated debug terminals
