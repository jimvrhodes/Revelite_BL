RT9478M I2C Communication Diagnostic

PROBLEM: All register reads return 0x0000 or garbage values despite chip responding to I2C scan at 0x6B

WORKING:
- I2C scan finds chip at 0x6B
- LatchRead/LatchWrite functions work perfectly for buttons (0x70, 0x71)
- I2C bus is stable at 50kHz

NOT WORKING:
- BQ25730_Read() returns garbage
- Every read returns different random values

NEXT STEPS TO TRY:
1. Use the working I2CM_SyncRead/SyncWrite functions (from subs.c) instead of raw I2C API
2. Verify actual I2C address - maybe chip is at 0x6A or 0x6C, not 0x6B
3. Check hardware: pullups, power supply voltage to RT9478M
4. Try reading with simpler single-byte read first before 16-bit reads

KEY INSIGHT FROM RICHTEK DATASHEET:
- Mfr ID should be 0x001E (not 0x0040)
- Dev ID should be 0x001C (not 0x0773)
- Register 0x40 (AuxFunction) is needed to unlock BATFET control
- ChargeOption0 bit 6 (ENZ_VSYS_UVP) must be 1 to disable UVP
